          <div id="band-content-text" >My name is Randy from Padang, West Sumatra. I graduated from Andalas University in mathematics major with a GPA of 3.23. During the college life, 
          I continued to improve my soft skills such as involving several organizations e.g.
           BEM KM FMIPA, HIMATIKA, and AIESEC; winning the 4th National Mathematics and Natural 
           Sciences Olympiad at the University level; and being a Campus Activist Star in the Faculty
            and Best Graphic Designer in the Department. In addition, I was a speaker in a Roundtable 
            Seminar: Exchange Student Collaboration between Andalas University and Ibaraki University. 
            Then, I became a judge of the Instagram Video Competition and Poster Competition. </div>
